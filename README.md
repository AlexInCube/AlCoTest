### üç™ Youtube Cookie
Also, it is preferable to provide cookies for YouTube.
This will allow you to play 18+ videos and bypass YouTube rate limiting error (429 Error).
I highly recommend that you create a new Google account from which you get the cookie.
You cannot watch videos in your browser from this account,
otherwise your cookie will be reset, and you will need to retrieve it again.

- Install an extension for extracting cookie, [EditThisCookie](https://www.editthiscookie.com/blog/2014/03/install-editthiscookie/)
- Go to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)
- Log in to your account. (You should use a new account for this purpose)
- Click on the extension icon and click "Export" button.
- Create file yt-cookies.json and paste cookie in this file

### üñ•Ô∏è Run locally
